<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Laser Gas Analyzers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>In-Situ</li><li>Extractive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>In the laser gas analyzers market, two primary types exist: in-situ and extractive analyzers. In-situ analyzers directly measure gas concentrations in the process environment without altering the gas stream, offering real-time data and minimal sampling errors. In contrast, extractive analyzers collect samples from the process stream, transport them to a separate measurement unit, and analyze the gases in a controlled setting. Both types cater to different applications, emphasizing accuracy, sensitivity, and response time in monitoring gas emissions.</p></p>
